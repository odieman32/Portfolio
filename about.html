    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brodie Detterman, and I am a Computer Science Student at Tiffin University. I am concentrating in software development and game design. Game design has been my main focus from the start of my college journey. I have learned to use the Unity engine and have learned the C# language through my computer science courses and through using Unity.</p>
    <p>I have had multiple projects using C#, including a mock Windows Forms desktop application and multiple game prototypes. In addition, I have skills in the Python language with multiple projects that have helped me learn. Overall, I am passionate about game design, and through my capstone project, I hope to show off what I have learned through my schooling.</p>
